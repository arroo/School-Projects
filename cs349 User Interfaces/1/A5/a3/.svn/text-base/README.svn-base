to add frames give focus to the slider and hold control for as long as you want extra animation
I started with 10 seconds of animation on the slider because it doesn't make much sense to start the program and then wait to populate the timer

I blurred the line between view and model a bit for the boolean and affinetransform arraylists because it's just way simpler to keep a single copy in each model than to make multi-dimensional arraylists for each drawn object and its frame information

colour button - use it to select stroke colour
draw button - use it to be able to draw on the canvas
erase button - use it to be able to erase from the canvas
select button - use it to be able to selec from the canvas in a lasso-style, then click and drag within the box to animate what is selected

pause - pause animation
play - play animation
reset - set animation to first frame

make run to make and run the program
