I used Android SDK 4.2.2 (API 17)

the avd setup is given in 'avd setup.png'

the way to load data onto the device is by following Jeff's procedure from piazza, and putting the files into the base directory for storage, no subfolders needed; if there is some difficulty, one of the first things the app does is print to the log the external storage directory, that is where the app looks for files so they should go there if it isn't the base folder

additions: the GIMP-like colour picker, the ability to drag the canvas to go throught the animation, the ability to zoom into the animation by pinching
